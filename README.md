<ol>
<li>How do I approach designing software?
<dl>
  <dt>What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?</dt>
  <dd>I've picked up some ability to work with triangles to create 3D surfaces.</dd>

  <dt>What design process did you follow for your project work?</dt>
  <dd>I didn't deploy any real design process strategies.</dd>

  <dt>How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?</dt>
</dl></li>
<li>How do I approach developing programs?
<dl>
  <dt>What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?</dt>
  <dd>I should have used structured programming skills to create function/method driven code that would have encapsulated the various phases of displaying 3D triangle meshes.</dd>

  <dt>How did iteration factor into your development?</dt>
  <dd>As new abilities, such as using textures to cover surfaces, were added they needed to be added to the code we were working on.</dt>

  <dt>How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?</dt>
  <dd>It didn't really. My project was a failure.</dd>
</dl></li>

<li>How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
<dl>
  <dt>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?</dt>
  <dd>3D graphics would be nice to have to display stratigraphic models used in generating synthetic seismograms.</dd>

  <dt>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?</dt>
  <dd>It's another tool for the toolbox. Something to be used when a need presents itself.</dd>
