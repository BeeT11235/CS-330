  <dt>What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?</dt>
  <dd>I've picked up some ability to work with triangles to create 3D surfaces.</dd>

  <dt>What design process did you follow for your project work?</dt>
  <dd>I didn't deploy any real design process strategies.</dd>

  <dt>How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?</dt>

<li>How do I approach developing programs?</li>
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I should have used structured programming skills to create function/method driven code that would have encapsulated the various phases of displaying 3D triangle meshes.

How did iteration factor into your development?
As new abilities, such as using textures to cover surfaces, were added they needed to be added to the code we were working on.


How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
It didn't really. My project was a failure.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
3D graphics would be nice to have to display stratigraphic models used in generating synthetic seismograms.


How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
It's another tool for the toolbox. Something to be used when a need presents itself
